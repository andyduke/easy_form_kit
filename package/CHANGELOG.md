* Added compatibility with Material You.
* **Breaking change!** The signature of the `EasyForm.of()` method has been changed so that it always returns `EasyFormState` or throws an exception if `EasyForm` is not found in the context. The old version of this method, which returns nullable, has been renamed `EasyForm.maybeOf()`.
* `EasyForm.onWillPop` has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Use `PopScope` around `EasyForm` instead.

### `EasyCustomFormField`:
* `valueGet` & `valueSet` now accept a nullable `value` parameter.
* `controllerBuilder` & `recreateController` now return a non-null controller type.
* `setValue` now accepts a nullable `value` parameter.
* The `builder` callback now accepts a non-null controller type.

## 2.0.0-nullsafety.1

* Added exception handling in `onSave` and `onSaved` callbacks.

## 1.0.5

* The `build` method of the `EasyFormGenericField` widget now has a default implementation that throws a `UnimplementedError`. Now it is not necessary to implement this method if the class inherited from `EasyFormGenericFieldState` has its own implementation of the `build` method.
